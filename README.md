# QUANTAS
A Quantitative User-friendly Adaptive Networksed Things Abstract Simulator.

This project is a simulator that enables quantitative performance analysis of distributed algorithms. It has a number of attractive features. QUANTAS is an abstract simulator, therefore, the obtained results are not affected by the specifics of a particular network or operating system architecture. QUANTAS allows distributed algorithms researchers to quickly investigate a potential solution  and collect data about its performance. QUANTAS programming is relatively straightforward and is accessible to theoretical researchers.
